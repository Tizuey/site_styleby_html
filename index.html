    de "Ciências da Computação", no qual eu persisto apenas para ter o &#128220 diploma,pois nela eu <br>

   <p>" You don't want someone else's fate man, your fate's enough and your adventure is enough, it's plenty,
     it's more than you can ever fully realize and so that's also part of the reason that we all believe that
     the individual has some intrinsic dignity.<br>
     Don't be so sure that your position and your room is so damn trivial, becuase might be your attitude towards 
     it that's trivial, and if you're in dire straits and dire circumstances, just look at how much opportunity you
    have to make things better.<br>
    We're built to walk uphill and when you reach the pinnacle of the hill you want to stop and appreciate the vision, but
    the next thing you want is a higher hill in the distance, because it's the uphill climb  that we derive our
    value and i mean this technically.<br>
    But it is frustrating, it's like sisyphus pushing the rock uphill, but it's not, because as you pursue that goal you put
    yourself together and your life does get better and richer and more abundant, that's why the highest levels of virtue and goal
    are in some sense transcendent, you want them to be above everything, you're doing so you can continually move towards something 
    that's more sublime and better that's what you are you're here to live not to not to sleep ... "<br>
